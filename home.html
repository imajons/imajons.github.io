	<h2><a id="1"></a>About</h2>
	<p>After a lifetime of intense musical training, dedication to teaching and performing, a musician's life knows few masters other than passion and dedication.  Then life happens, and the railroad melts in the hands of the unexpected turns life takes.  You swirl about for a bit, dizzy enough to believe that HEY ... I CAN BECOME A GRAPHIC DESIGNER!  Although it didn't come from nowhere my mother tells me.  Constantly drawing little characters and doodling growing up, putting a pen stroke on paper I recognize now was a form of meditation for me.  A place where breathing was easy.  And because new life starts with a breath, the birth of my journey into graphic design was an easy one.</p>  

	<p>The spark may have been lit when reading childrens books for my young son, and realizing that I enjoyed the stories and illustrations as much as he did.  Colors, patterns, paper, making physical books, writing books, drawing, web design, and hating to love geometric shapes, has given me new tools to tell a story.<a href="#top"><p>back to top</p></a></p>

    <h2><a id="2"></a>Projects</h2>
	<p>Having studied graphic design and illustration at the MFA school, I have a particular interest in finding ways to tell a story.  I have loved writing books, particularly for kids, and I have plans to combine this passion with my current work as a music educator.  Having put together an interactive childrens show with my band Know Orchestra, we have enjoyed visiting Boston area schools to introduce the orchestral instruments to kids who otherwise might not get a chance to see and hear them.   Having done all the graphic design for the band, I am itching to get a musical book out there, perhaps the Know Orchestra Alphabet?  And now I am curious to see if I can combine all of that with my love of coding.  How do you tell a story, with music, on a web page?  Stay tuned.<a href="#top"><p>back to top</p></a></p>
